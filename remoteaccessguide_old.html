        <h2>Remote Access Guide</h2>
        <p>Enabling remote access so you can use nzb360 outside of your home is quite easy and completely free. Follow the steps below to enable remote (3G/4G/LTE) access to nzb360.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Create Dynamic DNS Address</h3>
        <p>A dynamic DNS address allows you to have a URL point to your home. Every modem receives an IP address from your ISP, but that IP address may change often. A dynamic dns address allows you to access your home's IP address, even if it changes.</p>
        
        <p>There are many services out there they will provide you a dynamic DNS address. Here are a few options...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://duckdns.org/">DuckDNS</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/">Afraid.org</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://dyndnss.net/eng/">DynDNS</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.noip.com/remote-access">No-IP</a> (what this guide is based on)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>We're going to use No-IP for the sake of this guide, as it is widely supported by routers and has many tutorials online. However, it does require you to click a "renew" email once every 30 days. If you don't want to do this, and want to follow a separate guide, I recommend using DuckDNS over No-IP if your router supports it.</p>
        
        <p>To get started, head over to <a href="https://www.noip.com/remote-access">No-IP</a> and sign up for the FREE version of this service.</p>
        
        <p>Once you have an account, follow <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/getting-started-with-no-ip-com/">this No-IP guide</a> to get your dynamic dns address.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Add Dynamic DNS info to home router</h3>
        <p>In order for your dynamic dns address to stay in sync with your IP address given by your ISP, it must be updated. Most modern routers have this functionality built in. For No-IP users, you can use <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/">this guide</a> for common routers. If your router isn't included in this guide simply Google how to enable Dynamic DNS for your router model and follow the instructions.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Set reserved DHCP Addresses</h3>
        <p>Most of the time, a router will automatically assign a computer an IP address at random. This creates a problem in the next step, so we want to keep this computer's IP address static. You can do this in your router as well.</p>
        
        <p>Simply Google how to reserve an IP address for your router model. You will need your computer's MAC address that is running the usenet/torrent services. Enter in the MAC address and specify which IP address you would like that PC to have (usually 192.168.X.X). Once you enable that in your router, restart your router and your computer.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Forward the correct ports</h3>
        <p>By now, we have a No-IP URL, and a reserved IP address for the PC running the usenet/torrent services. Now we need some way to talk to the computer when you visit the No-IP address. Port forwarding accomplishes this.</p>
        
        <p>Simply Google how to port forward for your specific router model. All you're essentially doing with port forwarding is telling your router to talk to a specific computer when a certain port is reached.</p>
        
        <p>For example, SABnzbd's default port is 8080. In your router, you will want to forward port 8080 to the reserved IP address you set up for your computer in Step 3.</p>
        
        <p>You can test if this is working by visiting your no-ip address and specifying a port. For example, if you forwarded port 8080 to your computer running SABnzbd correctly, then visiting <code>http://yourcustomdomain.no-ip.org:8080</code> should bring you to your SABnzbd web configuration.</p>
        
        <p>You will need to do this for ALL of your different services you're running (Sonarr, Radarr, Sab, NZBget, etc) and their associated ports to the same IP address you set in Step 3 of this guide.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Update your nzb360 Info</h3>
        <p>Now you will need to update nzb360's connection settings to support both local and remote connections.</p>
        
        <p>For brevity purposes, I will use SABnzbd as the example. The same procedure would apply to all services within nzb360.</p>
        
        <p>First, we will now want to change the Primary Connection String to use our new Dynamic DNS address created in Step 1 and the forwarded port created in Step 4.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/rag1.jpg" alt="Primary Connection String">
        
        <p>Hit the test connection button to verify this new address is working correctly. If you get a success, you can also enable the "Local Connection Handling" option, which will auto switch your connection parameters when you're on your local wifi network or away from home. This is helpful to maintain a super fast connection at home, but then switch to your remote address when away.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/rag2.jpg" alt="Local Connection Handling">
        
        <p>Simply enable the option and type in your local connection address (if you already had this filled out in the Primary Connection String, you would put that here now instead).</p>
        
        <p>Next, you need to add your home's WiFi network name(s) to nzb360's Local network SSID setting below. If you have more than one network name (MyHome and MyHome-5G for example) then simply comma separate them like so <code>MyHome, MyHome-5G</code>. nzb360 will auto-switch to this local address whenever you're on these Wifi networks.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The best way to test if nzb360 will work remotely is to simply try the Primary Connection String in your browser. If you can't connect to your service in Chrome (<code>http://yourcustomdomain.noip.me:XXXX</code>) then nzb360 will not work.</li>
            <li>Ensure your ports are forwarded correctly.</li>
            <li>Ensure the local IP address your ports are forward to internally is correct (the computer running your services).</li>
            <li>Make sure no firewall rules are blocking external access for your services.</li>
        </ul>
