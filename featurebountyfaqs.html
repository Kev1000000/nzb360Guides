        <h2>Feature Bounty FAQs</h2>
        <p>The Feature Bounty system was designed to allow the community to support the development of features that are not on the roadmap for nzb360 by purchasing credits that can be applied to the features you're interested in.</p>
        
        <h3>Why did you take this approach?</h3>
        <p>The community continually requests amazing feature ideas that exceed my ability to deliver on all of them. Instead of never getting to these ideas, and to help bring in additional revenue to support the development of nzb360, I wanted to provide an option for the community to prioritize specific features to the top of the development roadmap.</p>
        
        <h3>Will all new features be going through this system?</h3>
        <p>No, the development of new features that were always planned or in-scope for most users will continue to be developed as always. The only features that will be added as a feature bounty will follow this criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The feature wasn't already planned to be developed.</li>
            <li>The feature is possible to be added and has gone through a due diligence to ensure its validity.</li>
            <li>A review of the time/effort/maintainability of a feature will be conducted to set the appropriate bounty threshold.</li>
            <li>If the bounty is met, I will commit to adding that feature within a reasonable time frame, dependent on the effort required to develop it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How do I request a feature to be added as a feature bounty?</h3>
        <p>Simply use the Send Feedback form within settings, join our Discord channel, post a suggestion on Reddit, etc. If I receive enough initial support or requests for a particular feature, I will begin the due diligence to investigate whether or not it should be added as a Feature Bounty.</p>
        
        <h3>What if I apply credits to a feature that never reaches its bounty?</h3>
        <p>If a feature fails to meet its bounty after a significant time period, the feature may be removed and all applied credits you made to that feature will be returned to your account to apply to a different feature.</p>
        
        <h3>Do I have to support a feature bounty to use the feature once it's developed?</h3>
        <p>No, once a feature bounty is met and shipped, it will be available to all users (although some features may require a PRO license).</p>
        
        <h3>Additional Questions</h3>
        <p>You can always reach me directly through the built in Send Feedback feature within the app or at nzb360@gmail.com if you have any additional questions regarding this feature bounty system.</p>
