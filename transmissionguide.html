        <h2>Transmission Setup Guide</h2>
        <p>This guide will walk you through the steps to get nzb360 connected to Transmission running on your computer. If you haven't already, download and install <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> on your computer.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Choose Transmission as your client</h3>
        <p>nzb360 supports many different Torrent clients. Make sure to choose Transmission by tapping the row above primary connection string.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Set up Remote Access</h3>
        <p>You must enable remote access in Transmission to allow nzb360 to connect. Follow the steps below to enable within Transmission.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on Edit -> Preferences.</li>
            <li>Click on the last tab (Remote)</li>
            <li>Make sure "Allow remote access" is selected</li>
            <li>Write down which HTTP port is listed (most likely 9091)</li>
            <li>It is strongly recommended to add a username and password. Enable the "Use authentication" box and add a username and password that you'll remember.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note: Keep an eye on the HTTP port in this view. You'll need it the next step.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Primary Connection Address</h3>
        <p>Once you've enabled remote access, you will need to add your primary connection address into nzb360's Torrent's settings, shown below.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/transmission3.jpg" alt="Primary Connection Address">
        
        <p>NOTE: nzb360 appends <strong>/transmission</strong> automatically for you. Do not add it to the primary connection string for Transmission, even if you use a reverse proxy/URL rewrite.</p>
        
        <p>To find your primary connection address, follow <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-ip-address-817565">this guide</a> to find your <strong>PRIVATE/LOCAL</strong> IP address. It will usually look something like <code>http://192.168.X.X</code>.</p>
        
        <p>Add your IP address to the primary connection string field, along with the HTTP port from the Remote Access settings. Add a colon between the IP address and HTTP port.</p>
        
        <p>Transmission uses port 9091 by default, so your Primary Connection String should look something like <code>http://192.168.X.X:9091</code></p>
        
        <p>If you're using a <strong>remote</strong> address (not a local IP address) then you'll want to use that in your Primary Connection Address.</p>
        
        <p>Once you've entered in your Primary Connection Address, move on to step 4.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Adding your password</h3>
        <p>If you added a username/password in Step 2, you will need to enter those within the username/password field in nzb360.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Test your connection</h3>
        <p>nzb360 allows you to test your connection from the settings screen to see if things will work.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Note: Your mobile device MUST be on the same network as Transmission (if you're using a local connection, i.e. 192.168.x.x). Make sure your mobile device is on your home wifi.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Press the Test Connection button.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you get a <span class="button-success">Success</span> you're all set!</li>
            <li>If you get a <span class="button-failed">Failed to Connect</span> follow the troubleshooting tips below.</li>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your Primary Connection String is correct.</li>
            <li>Double check your username/password.</li>
            <li>Try logging into Transmission's Web UI via your browser on your computer by typing in your Primary Connection String exactly. If you can't connect via this method, nzb360 won't work either.</li>
            <li>Make sure no firewall rules are blocking external access.</li>
            <li>Make sure you're on the same network and are connected via wifi on your mobile device.</li>
            <li>Make sure Transmission is running on your PC and remote access is enabled.</li>
        </ul>
