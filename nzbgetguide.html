        <h2>NZBget Setup Guide</h2>
        <p>This guide will walk you through the steps to get nzb360 connected to NZBget running on your computer. If you haven't already, download and install <a href="https://nzbget.net">NZBget</a> on your computer and configure it to connect to your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/providers">usenet provider</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Primary Connection Address</h3>
        <p>The first step in connecting nzb360 to NZBget is filling in your primary connection address into nzb360's NZBget settings, shown below.</p>

        <p>You can find your primary connection address by looking at the URL in your browser on your PC when NZBget is running.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/nzbget2.png" alt="Primary Connection Address">
        
        <p>If your URL shows http://127.0.0.1:6789 or http://localhost:6789 that is not accurate, as it is referring to your localhost address. You will need to find your private IP address for your computer running NZBget. Follow <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-ip-address-817565">this guide</a> to find your <strong>PRIVATE</strong> IP address.</p>
        
        <p>The :6789 is the port number NZBget is running on. By default, NZBget uses port 6789. If you haven't changed it, then :6789 is probably what you'll want to use to start.</p>
        
        <p>If you're using a <strong>remote</strong> address (not a local IP address) then you'll want to use that in your Primary Connection Address.</p>
        
        <p>Once you've entered in your Primary Connection Address, move on to step 2.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Adding your User/Password</h3>
        <p>NZBget is secured via a username and password, which you must enter into nzb360 to connect to NZBget. You can find your username and password by launching NZBget and clicking on Settings -> Security.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/nzbget3.png" alt="User/Pass">
        
        <p>Look for <em>ControlUsername</em> and <em>ControlPassword</em>. Type those two values into nzb360's NZBget Username and Password fields (shown below).</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Test your connection</h3>
        <p>nzb360 allows you to test your connection from the settings screen to see if things will work.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Note: Your mobile device MUST be on the same network as NZBget (if you're using a local connection, i.e. 192.168.x.x). Make sure your mobile device is on your home wifi.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Press the Test Connection button.</p>
