        <h2>Lidarr Setup Guide</h2>
        <p>This guide will walk you through the steps to get nzb360 connected to Lidarr running on your computer. If you haven't already, download and install <a href="https://lidarr.audio/">Lidarr</a> on your computer.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Primary Connection Address</h3>
        <p>The first step in connecting nzb360 to Lidarr is filling in your primary connection address into nzb360's Lidarr settings, shown below.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/lidarr1.jpg" alt="Primary Connection Address">
        
        <p>You can find your primary connection address by looking at the URL in your browser on your PC when Lidarr is running.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/lidarr2.png" alt="Primary Connection Address">
        
        <p>If your URL shows http://localhost:8686 or http://127.0.0.1:8686 that is not accurate, as it is referring to your localhost address. You will need to find your private IP address for your computer running Lidarr. Follow <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-ip-address-817565">this guide</a> to find your <strong>PRIVATE</strong> IP address.</p>
        
        <p>The :8686 is the port number Lidarr is running on. By default, Lidarr uses port 8686. If you haven't changed it, then :8686 is probably what you'll want to use to start.</p>
        
        <p>If you're using a <strong>remote</strong> address (not a local IP address) then you'll want to use that in your Primary Connection Address.</p>
        
        <p>Once you've entered in your Primary Connection Address, move on to step 2.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Adding your API key</h3>
        <p>An API key is a unique/random key that is given to you by Lidarr that acts as a password to allow apps like nzb360 to communicate securely to it. It must be added to nzb360 exactly as it appears in Lidarr.</p>
        
        <img src="https://nzb360.com/guides/imgs/sonarr3.png" alt="API Key">
        
        <p>To find your specific API key, follow the steps below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With Lidarr launched in your browser, click on the Settings tab on the left.</li>
            <li>Click the General Tab.</li>
            <li>Under security, find the <strong>API Key</strong> field.</li>
            <li>Copy this key and send it to your mobile device.</li>
            <li>Paste it in nzb360's Lidarr API Key field.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note, if you have authentication setup, the API Key will bypass it when using nzb360. You do not need to add your username or password for Lidarr to nzb360.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Test your connection</h3>
        <p>nzb360 allows you to test your connection from the settings screen to see if things will work.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Note: Your mobile device MUST be on the same network as Lidarr (if you're using a local connection, i.e. 192.168.x.x). Make sure your mobile device is on your home wifi.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Press the Test Connection button.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you get a <span class="button-success">Success</span> you're all set!</li>
            <li>If you get a <span class="button-failed">Failed to Connect</span> follow the troubleshooting tips below.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your Primary Connection String is correct.</li>
            <li>Double check your API key.</li>
            <li>Make sure no firewall rules are blocking external access. If on Windows, run Lidarr as Administrator once to auto-add a firewall rule for external connections.</li>
            <li>Make sure you're on the same network and are connected via wifi on your mobile device.</li>
            <li>If you're having issues with Quality Profiles or Root Folders not syncing, make sure to add your URL Base field to your primary/local connection strings.</li>
        </ul>
